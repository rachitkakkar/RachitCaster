# Status
MAJOR WORK IN PROGRESS, THE CODE IS BEING REFACTORED TO AN OBJECT BASED MODEL WITH COMMENTS (JSDOC) IN `src/`
- Sprites will be added in the future!

# About
- Features textures, a mini-map, procedural/maze generation, doors, fully implemented first person controller (including strafe and up/down mouselook), and more!
- Uses modern Javascript features such as classes, modules, JSDoc, PointerLock API, etc.

*This project started as a quest to improve a much older raycaster I made a long time ago, and the original code plus its README can be found in the `Version 1` directory.*

# Credits
Much of the work here is inspired by Lode Vandevenne's excellent tutorials on raycasting.

<!-- # Demonstrations
This project is hosted online with Github pages, however a video demonstration can be seen in the `demonstration.mp4` file -->
